title: "Shipping a payment product is not the same as launching a website"
excerpt: "Go-live is when operations start. Monitoring, retries, and support are part of the product — not a phase you add later."

A marketing site can launch and then sit. A payment product cannot.

Once real money moves, you are in operations: failed prompts, delayed tokens, customers who paid twice, providers who retry, and support threads that need a reference number — not a screenshot of a spinner.

## What we ship with the product

**Observability.** You should be able to answer “what happened to reference X?” without SSH. Status, webhook history, and provider response belong in one place.

**Retries with a ceiling.** Failed HTTP calls to a provider get backoff. They do not get a `while true`.

**A support path that uses the same IDs as engineering.** If support cannot find the payment, the customer will try again and you will double-charge.

**An honest pending state.** “Waiting for approval” is better than a green check you have to walk back.

## What we do not treat as launch criteria

Pixel-perfect empty states. A fifth animation. A dashboard nobody will open on day one.

Those can follow. Incorrect settlement cannot.

## The three-step engagement we use

1. **Discover** — goals, channels, success metrics, and the failure cases you are willing to live with.
2. **Build** — design and engineering in short cycles, with sandbox tests that include declines.
3. **Launch and support** — production keys, monitoring, and a named person who still answers after week two.

That is how payment work actually happens: discover, build, then stay for launch and support.
